# Agentic-Framework-An-intent-driven-multi-agent-computing-environment

A Voice-Enabled Multi-Agent System
Transforming traditional computing into an intelligent, intent-driven operating environment.

What is Agentic Framework?

It is a speech-enabled, multi-agent system prototype that allows users to interact with their computer using natural language. Instead of manually switching between apps, the system: 
Understands your intent
Breaks down complex goals
Coordinates specialized agents
Executes tasks autonomously
Built entirely in Python with a modular architecture.
