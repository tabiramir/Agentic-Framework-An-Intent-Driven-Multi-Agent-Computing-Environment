# Agentic-Framework-An-intent-driven-multi-agent-computing-environment

A Voice-Enabled Multi-Agent System
Transforming traditional computing into an intelligent, intent-driven operating environment.


# What is Agentic Framework?

It is a speech-enabled, multi-agent system prototype that allows users to interact with their computer using natural language. Instead of manually switching between apps, the system: 
Understands your intent
Breaks down complex goals
Coordinates specialized agents
Executes tasks autonomously
Built entirely in Python with a modular architecture.

# Key Features

● Voice-First Interaction - Wake word activation (“Hey Agent”), Real-time Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Whisper-based offline speech recognition, Text-to-speech responses

● Multi-Agent Architecture - Planner Agent (central coordinator), Reminder Agent, File Manager Agent, Web Search Agent, Mail Agent (Gmail integration), Booking Agent, Browser Control Agent, Process Monitor Agent, Sleep / Wake Control Agent, App Close Agent

● Intelligent NLP Pipeline - Intent refinement engine, nlu, Entity extraction (spaCy), Fuzzy matching (RapidFuzz), Date parsing (dateparser), Structured command normalization

● Real-Time GUI (NiceGUI) - Live transcription, Siri-style audio animation, Agent state visualization, Structured logs
